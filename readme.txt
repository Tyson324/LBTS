A few things to bear in mind before editing anything:

The files were initialy generated by axure, i just took out all the unececary code and files and left the necesary ones.

You may find unusual filenames like 'u34.img' or something similar, this was axure's doing. 

If you want to change the filename to something more appropriate, remember to also change the filename in the css and html
files also.

Last thing, be courteous and leave comments on the changes you make, so there are as little conflictions and mix ups
as possible.
